# IMusic

This job is the biggest one for me so far! This project was done with the educational portal https://swiftbook.org/

The essence of the application is terribly clear, namely the implementation of Apple Music or something similar)

It was touched by many new topics, and for this course I learned a lot! Just all the sources of the project, I will attach, so you can easily download the source code and open them immediately in the finished application
